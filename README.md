# Project Description: 
KenanDeari.com is a personal resume website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I researched creative & unique libraries that can be applied to provide a better user experience. I required a modern yet pretty CSS library and came across Animate.css. I ended up using Animate.css along with CSS & JS to add responsiveness. Key-frames that were implemented provided a flexible way to use Animate.css without having to refactor the HTML code for each user's compatibility. Custom fonts, FontAwsome, & Favicon were inserted to create a visual experience for each user. Modernizr is a JavaScript library that detects the features available in a user's browser; this lets web pages avoid unsupported features by informing the user their browser isn't supported. PACE (Automatic page load progress bar) was added to create a visual effect when in a queue to view my website. Due to my experience using S3, Route 53, and CloudFront offered by Amazon Web Services, I was able to purchase and host my website on the domain of my choice. CloudFront was utilized to create an encrypted connection with SSL to verify ownership to each user. 

# User Story: 
As a user, I want the ability to review Kenan Deari's experience & qualifications. So that I can learn to make an educated decision on his skills and experience.

# Mobile Responsivess 

KenanDeari.com has mobile-responsiveness as a high priority. The majority of today's web-traffic is done via mobile applications, therefore it's important to provide a stable mobile website. The website was created using a 12-grid system to optimize the screens' space. In each CSS file, the @media rules were used for the media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices.
