# Project Description: 
KenanDeari.com is a personal resume website created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I researched creative & unique libaries that can be applied to provide a better user-experience, I ended up using Animate.css that was customized with CSS & JS. Key-frames were implimented to provide a flexible way to use Animate.css without having to refactor the HTML code. Custom fonts, FontAwsome, & Favicon were inserted to create a visual experience for each user. Modernizr is a JavaScript library that detects the features available in a user's browser. This lets web pages avoid unsupported features by informing the user their browser isn't supported. PACE (Automatic page load progress bar) was added to create a visual effect when in que to view my website. 

# User Story: 
As a user, I want the ability to review Kenan Deari's experince & qualifcations. So that I can learn to make an educated decison on his skills and experience.
